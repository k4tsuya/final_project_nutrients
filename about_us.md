> Version 1

We are Mariana, Jeffrey, Denis, and Liang, and we started where many junior developers do: with a mix of excitement and sheer panic. Our mission was to build an intelligent nutrition app from scratch.

The journey was tough—we wrestled with unpredictable code and felt lost in bugs more than once. But our true breakthrough wasn't technical; it was human. We built a "culture of doing mistakes," fueled by unwavering support that turned four individual coders into a single, problem-solving team.

The app is what we built, but the real product is who we became.

To every developer feeling the pressure: your greatest asset isn't just your code, but the team you build around it. Trust the process and each other. You've got this.

> Version 2


We’re Mariana, Jeffrey, Denis, and Liang—four creators who decided to build something cool together.

Think of this app as our big idea, dreamed up on a sunny day. We brought our different skills in design, code, and planning to create a tool that makes healthy living simple and maybe even a little fun.

It’s our little piece of digital sunshine, built from scratch with a ton of teamwork and good vibes. We hope it makes your day a little brighter.

> Version 3

We believe software should feel less like a machine and more like a conversation.

So we deconstructed the whole concept of a nutrition app and built our own, from the command line up.

**Jeffrey** sculpted the visuals. **Denis** wrangled the backend logic. **Liang** forged the artisanal APIs that connect everything. And **Mariana** orchestrated the beautiful chaos.

This isn’t just a product; it’s our statement on how tech should feel: human, intuitive, and thoughtfully made.
