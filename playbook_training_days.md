## **Mariana's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Project Manager** and the **Storyteller**. Your job is to set the stage with a powerful intro and bring the presentation home with a heartfelt thank you.

*   **Your Cue:** The presentation begins. You are the first speaker.
*   **Action:** Dennis will have Slide #1 displayed.

> **Your Script:**
> "Good morning. What if your nutrition app was for more than just weight loss?
>
> What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?
>
> This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.
>
> We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.
>
> We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana.
>
> **And now, I'll hand you over to Jeffrey** to show you exactly how it works."

## **Jeffrey's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Pâtissier / Decorator** and the **User's Guide**. Your job is to own the live demo and moderate the Q&A.

#### **Performance #1: The Live Demo**
*   **Time Allotted:** 7 minutes
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Jeffrey."
*   **Action:** Start your screen share.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thank you, Mariana. For today, you will imagine that I've invited my Grandma to be our official app tester. So, please imagine that I am presenting this just for her.
>
> *(Shifts tone to be warmer, more personal)*
>
> Hey Grandma, this is a nutrition tracker for all your macro and micro nutrients... *(...continue with the full demo script as practiced...)* ...See? The chart fills up to show your progress. It's that easy.
>
> Now, we want to explain how we built this app. But to not make it complicated for you, Grandma, we will talk in your language. Instead of being software developers, for today, we are a **bakery**. The app is our cake. I was the 'decorator,' making the app look good for you. But a beautiful cake needs a great team of bakers and a well-run store. **To explain how it all came together, I'll hand you over to Denis.**"

#### **Performance #2: Q&A Moderation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 35 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana to finish her final thank you.
*   **Action:** Dennis will switch to the Q&A slide.

> **Your Script:**
> "And now, we'd love to open the floor for any questions. To make sure we have time for everyone, we'll take one question per person, and we have five minutes total for this block. We also kindly ask that you keep questions simple, so that friends and family can follow along. We promise to answer in the same simple language. **Thank you, and who has the first question?**"

*   **Action:** Resume screen sharing and display Slide #2.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Jeffrey. As he said, to create this app, our bakery had three main working spaces.
>
> First, in the **kitchen**, our bakers—Liang and I—planned the app's structure. For this, we used powerful 'appliances' like **Django** and **PostgreSQL**.
>
> Second, in the **pâtisserie**, our decorator Jeffrey made the cake look beautiful using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
>
> And third, at the **store**, Mariana managed the entire operation—logistics, customer care, and the delivery pipeline—using systems like **Jira, GitHub Projects, and a CI/CD Pipeline**.
>
> **And now, Liang will talk about our challenges and what's next for the bakery.**"
