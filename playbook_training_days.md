## **Mariana's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Project Manager** and the **Storyteller**. Your job is to set the stage with a powerful intro and bring the presentation home with a heartfelt thank you.

#### **Performance #1: The Introduction**
*   **Time Allotted:** 1 minute, 30 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** The presentation begins. You are the first speaker.
*   **Action:** Dennis will have Slide #1 displayed.

> **Your Script:**
> "Good morning. What if your nutrition app was for more than just weight loss?
>
> What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?
>
> This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.
>
> We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.
>
> We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana.
>
> **And now, I'll hand you over to Jeffrey** to show you exactly how it works."

#### **Performance #2: The Final Thanks**
*   **Time Allotted:** 25 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Liang to finish his last line.
*   **Action:** Dennis will advance to Slide #4.

## **Jeffrey's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Pâtissier / Decorator** and the **User's Guide**. Your job is to own the live demo and moderate the Q&A.

#### **Performance #1: The Live Demo**
*   **Time Allotted:** 7 minutes
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Jeffrey."
*   **Action:** Start your screen share.

> **Your Script:**
> Thank you, Mariana. For today, you will imagine that I'm talking to a Grandma as our official app tester. So, please imagine that I am presenting this just for her, she must be able to spread the word to her friends.
>
> *(Shifts tone to be warmer, more personal)*
>
> Hey Grandma, this app will make your life much easier. Think of it as a smart recipe book that knows you personally.
>
> This is an intelligent cookbook and a nutrition consultant with a tracking function: First, you create a profile. *(Shows the sign-up form)*. This just means you give us your basic data, like your name and age, and the app will remember you every time you visit. It's like having your own personalized kitchen files.
>
> Once you're in, the magic happens. Every time you tell the app what you ate—let's say an avocado for lunch—it will be saved. At the end of the day, you can look at your dashboard *(this is the dashboard .... )* and see if your meals were good, healthy, or if they could be improved.
>
> And how do you know? We made a very simple light system, just like the traffic lights you know so well. *(Points to the charts on the screen)*
> * Green stands for a good decision—you're getting enough of the good stuff!
> * Yellow is for precaution—you're on your way, but could use a little more.
> * Red is a red flag—a gentle hint that you might be having too much of something.
>
> No judgment, just simple guidance.
>
> So, in this first version of the app, you can do four amazing things:
> 1. You can track the quality of your meals. You can see your history for the day, the week, the month, and even the whole year to see how you're improving.
> 2. You can actively search our database or lets call it dictionary. Curious what's in a potato? Just type it in. Or, if you need more Magnesium, you can search for 'Magnesium' and see all the foods that contain it.
> 3. Grandma, you must drink enough water! This app helps you track your hydration. With every glass, you just click this button... *(Clicks the water icon and the chart animates)* ...and the chart fills up. It's that easy.
>
> And coming soon, we will have automated recipes based on your unique nutritional needs to help you achieve your goals even faster.
>
> Now, we want to explain how we built this app. But to not make it complicated for you, Grandma, we will talk in your language. Instead of being software developers, for today, we are in a bakery. The app is our cake. I was the 'decorator,' making the app look good for you. But a beautiful cake needs a great team of bakers and a well-run store. To explain how it all came together, I'll hand you over to Denis.

#### **Performance #2: Q&A Moderation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 35 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana to finish her final thank you.
*   **Action:** Dennis will switch to the Q&A slide.

> **Your Script:**
> "And now, we'd love to open the floor for any questions. To make sure we have time for everyone, we'll take one question per person, and we have five minutes total for this block. We also kindly ask that you keep questions simple, so that friends and family can follow along. We promise to answer in the same simple language. **Thank you, and who has the first question?**"

## **Denis's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Architect** and the **Slide Master**. Your job is to make the technical explanation simple and ensure the visual flow is perfect.

#### **Performance #1: The Technical Explanation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 45 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Jeffrey's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Denis."
*   **Action:** Resume screen sharing and display Slide #2.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Jeffrey. As he said, to create this app, our bakery had three main working spaces.
>
> First, in the **kitchen**, our bakers—Liang and I—planned the app's structure. For this, we used powerful 'appliances' like **Django** and **PostgreSQL**.
>
> Second, in the **pâtisserie**, our decorator Jeffrey made the cake look beautiful using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
>
> And third, at the **store**, Mariana managed the entire operation—logistics, customer care, and the delivery pipeline—using systems like **Jira, GitHub Projects, and a CI/CD Pipeline**.
>
> **And now, Liang will talk about our challenges and what's next for the bakery.**"

## **Liang's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Baker** and the **Visionary**. Your job is to talk about the team's resilience and the exciting future of the project.

#### **Performance #1: Challenges & Future**
*   **Time Allotted:** 30 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Denis's hand-off: "...Liang will talk about our challenges..."
*   **Action:** Dennis will advance to Slide #3.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Denis. Our biggest challenge was hiding all the complexity. Making something feel this simple took a lot of late nights to pass our 'Grandma Test.'
>
> But those challenges prepared us for the future. Our next steps are to build a custom recipe creator, use AI for personalized meal plans, and launch on the app stores."
