*   **Your Cue:** The presentation begins. You are the first speaker.
*   **Action:** Dennis will have Slide #1 displayed.

> **Your Script:**
> "Good morning. What if your nutrition app was for more than just weight loss?
>
> What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?
>
> This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.
>
> We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.
>
> We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana.
>
> **And now, I'll hand you over to Jeffrey** to show you exactly how it works."

## **Jeffrey's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Pâtissier / Decorator** and the **User's Guide**. Your job is to own the live demo and moderate the Q&A.

#### **Performance #1: The Live Demo**
*   **Time Allotted:** 7 minutes
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Jeffrey."
*   **Action:** Start your screen share.

> **Your Script:**
> Thank you, Mariana. For today, you will imagine that I'm talking to a Grandma as our official app tester. So, please imagine that I am presenting this just for her, she must be able to spread the word to her friends.
>
> *(Shifts tone to be warmer, more personal)*
>
> Hey Grandma, this app will make your life much easier. Think of it as a smart recipe book that knows you personally.
>
> This is an intelligent cookbook and a nutrition consultant with a tracking function: First, you create a profile. *(Shows the sign-up form)*. This just means you give us your basic data, like your name and age, and the app will remember you every time you visit. It's like having your own personalized kitchen files.
>
> Once you're in, the magic happens. Every time you tell the app what you ate—let's say an avocado for lunch—it will be saved. At the end of the day, you can look at your dashboard *(this is the dashboard .... )* and see if your meals were good, healthy, or if they could be improved.
>
> And how do you know? We made a very simple light system, just like the traffic lights you know so well. *(Points to the charts on the screen)*
> * Green stands for a good decision—you're getting enough of the good stuff!
> * Yellow is for precaution—you're on your way, but could use a little more.
> * Red is a red flag—a gentle hint that you might be having too much of something.
>
> No judgment, just simple guidance.
>
> So, in this first version of the app, you can do four amazing things:
> 1. You can track the quality of your meals. You can see your history for the day, the week, the month, and even the whole year to see how you're improving.
> 2. You can actively search our database or lets call it dictionary. Curious what's in a potato? Just type it in. Or, if you need more Magnesium, you can search for 'Magnesium' and see all the foods that contain it.
> 3. Grandma, you must drink enough water! This app helps you track your hydration. With every glass, you just click this button... *(Clicks the water icon and the chart animates)* ...and the chart fills up. It's that easy.
>
> And coming soon, we will have automated recipes based on your unique nutritional needs to help you achieve your goals even faster.
>
> Now, we want to explain how we built this app. But to not make it complicated for you, Grandma, we will talk in your language. Instead of being software developers, for today, we are in a bakery. The app is our cake. I was the 'decorator,' making the app look good for you. But a beautiful cake needs a great team of bakers and a well-run store. To explain how it all came together, I'll hand you over to Denis.

#### **Performance #2: Q&A Moderation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 35 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana to finish her final thank you.
*   **Action:** Dennis will switch to the Q&A slide.

> **Your Script:**
> "And now, we'd love to open the floor for any questions. To make sure we have time for everyone, we'll take one question per person, and we have five minutes total for this block. We also kindly ask that you keep questions simple, so that friends and family can follow along. We promise to answer in the same simple language. **Thank you, and who has the first question?**"

## **Denis's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Architect** and the **Slide Master**. Your job is to make the technical explanation simple and ensure the visual flow is perfect.

#### **Performance #1: The Technical Explanation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 45 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Jeffrey's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Denis."
*   **Action:** Resume screen sharing and display Slide #2.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Jeffrey. As he said, to create this app, our bakery had three main working spaces.
>
> First, in the **kitchen**, our bakers—Liang and I—planned the app's structure. For this, we used powerful 'appliances' like **Django** and **PostgreSQL**.
>
> Second, in the **pâtisserie**, our decorator Jeffrey made the cake look beautiful using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
>
> And third, at the **store**, Mariana managed the entire operation—logistics, customer care, and the delivery pipeline—using systems like **Jira, GitHub Projects, and a CI/CD Pipeline**.
>
> **And now, Liang will talk about our challenges and what's next for the bakery.**"

## **Liang's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Baker** and the **Visionary**. Your job is to talk about the team's resilience and the exciting future of the project.


### **Performance #1: Challenges & Future**

*   **Time Allotted:** 2min
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Denis's hand-off: Of course. This version simplifies the language, uses rhetorical questions to create more dynamic energy, and aims for a more conversational, "catchy" tone. It's structured to be delivered naturally and confidently within two minutes.

### **Liang's Presentation Script (Dynamic & Catchy Version)**

**(Instructions for Liang: Practice this to feel the rhythm. The questions are for you to ask the audience. Click the checkbox after each point to keep your place.)**

#### **Introduction (Transition from Denis)**

-   [ ] Thank you, Denis. That bakery analogy was perfect.
-   [ ] So, with the cake now built, I want to answer two simple questions for you all: **What’s next for our app?** And more importantly, **how did this project change *us*?**

---

#### **Part 1: So, Where Do We Go From Here?**

-   [ ] Let's start with what's next. You might be wondering, what's the next big feature?
-   [ ] Well, we want to make our traffic light system even smarter. Soon, it won't just tell you if you're getting enough of the good stuff—it will also warn you about too much of a good thing, like an overload of certain vitamins.
-   [ ] And of course, we want to bring people together. We’re already designing features for sharing your favorite recipes and creating truly personal meal plans.

---

#### **Part 2: So, How Did We Actually Pull This Off?**

-   [ ] That's the *what*. But the *how* is even more interesting. This project was a massive challenge, and every single one of us had to level up.
-   [ ] **Mariana?** She was the glue that held our team together. She became our project manager, our pipeline builder, and our lead researcher, guiding us through the tough spots.
-   [ ] **Jeffrey** became our artist. He taught himself the languages of the web—HTML, CSS, JavaScript—to create the beautiful, simple design you saw.
-   [ ] **Denis** became the tamer of the beast that is Django. He wrestled with the code, completely rebuilt our database, and made our app run lightning-fast.
-   [ ] And **me?** I was the engineer in the engine room, finding new ways to make our server stable and fast, no matter what we threw at it.

---

#### **Part 3: So, Was It a Smooth Ride?**

-   [ ] **Absolutely not.** And that’s the most important part of our story.
-   [ ] We were so excited at the start that we jumped into coding without a perfect plan. We felt nervous, we felt inexperienced.
-   [ ] I definitely felt the pressure. It made me realize, *"The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."*
-   [ ] **But here’s the secret:** Our biggest success wasn't the code. It was the culture we built.
-   [ ] We created a **"culture of doing mistakes,"** where everyone had a voice. As Mariana said, she **"lost her fears and gained self-confidence"** here.
-   [ ] That's what happens when you have a team with an **"open mind to talk about everything."** *That* was our real magic ingredient.

---

#### **Final Transition to Mariana**

-   [ ] And speaking of the person who was so central in talking about our vulnerabilities and strenghts, I’ll hand it back to Mariana for the final words of this presentation:

## **Team Rehearsal Feedback**

-   [ ] **Presentation:** Prepare simple, clear slides for the "Future Features" section.
-   [ ] **Future Features:** During your section, mention the plan to track vitamin safety/overload using the traffic light system visual.
-   [ ] **Team Learnings:** Prepare to talk about the new skills the team learned individually. Be sure to highlight:
    -   `Mariana`: Learned about Agile systems, writing pipelines, using advanced GitHub/GitLab features, coordinating sprints, and writing presentation pitches/playbooks. Also served a key role in research to support bug fixing.
    -   `Jeffrey`: Learned new languages and frameworks including HTML, CSS, and Java.
    -   `Liang`: Researched and implemented different libraries to improve server stability.
    -   `Denis`: Mastered Django's complexities, finding workarounds for its unpredictable behavior. He successfully restructured the database when new features required it and learned to optimize data fetching (e.g., using pagination and caching).
-   [ ] **Team Lead/Retrospective:** Lead a discussion and prepare to talk about the team's challenges and growth.
    -   **Key Themes and Quotes to Include:**
        -   **Initial Challenges:** "We were too exciting in coding, rather than having a plan," "biggest problem was to have a project owner and never talked about the key functions from the beginning," and a general "lack of communication about how the app should look."
        -   **Emotional Journey:** Talk about the initial feelings of being "nervous," "inexperienced," and "clueless," which led to struggles with the data approach and a "lack of clarity."
        -   **Individual Struggles & Growth:**
            -   Mention Denis's frustration with the "fix and fix and try again" cycle of debugging.
            -   Share your own feeling of pressure as team lead, the overestimation of performance, and the realization: *"The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."*
        -   **Positive Outcomes & Key Learnings:**
            -   Highlight Mariana's journey: "I lost my fears. Gained self-confidence."
            -   Emphasize the importance of the team environment: **"Support and an open mind to talk about everything,"** **"The culture of doing mistakes,"** and having a **"non-violent, funny, supportive"** atmosphere was crucial for success.
