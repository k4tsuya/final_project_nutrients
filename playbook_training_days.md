> ## **Mariana's Playbook**

> ##### **Performance #1: The Introduction**
*   **Time Allotted:** 2 minute, 30 seconds
> *   **Action:** Dennis will have Slide #1 displayed.

> ##### (Intro - 2 Min)**

-   [ ] Good morning every one. Question: *Are you overwhelmed* by the **flood of nutrition advice on social media?** *Your Instagram says one 
        thing, your TikTok says the complete opposite*, and you're left **wondering what's actually right** for *you*.
-   [ ] And let's be honest **almost every nutrition app asks you to count calories**, *as health was equal* **to losing weight.**
-   [ ] **Studies show that’s just wrong;** Here our solution:
-   [ ] We created **Bitamin**.
-   [ ] **An application tracking the macro and micro nutrients contained in your meals,** *classifying your diet with 3 colors, like the 
       light system,* **green, yellow, and red,** to know if you are **talking enough good stuff for yourself or not.** **to improve in your 
       daily nutrition decisions better.**
-   [ ] Maybe, for example you want **to improve your gut health, manage an allergy, or sleep deeper**. 
-   [ ] **Improving your health isn't about dieting;** it's about **understanding your body needs and setting individual goals.**
-   [ ] *The name is our entire philosophy:* a fusion of **Bit**—the **smallest unit of data**, and **Amin**—from **amino acids**, the 
       **fundamental blocks of nutrition.**

> ##### **Who We Are**

-   [ ] Our backend and app functionality creators are **Liang** and **Denis**.
-   [ ] The frontend approach is a modern, minimalistic design, by **Jeffrey**, clean and simple.
-   [ ] For the logistics, administration of processes, and tracking everything possible—that’s me, **Mariana**.


> ##### **The Story of Our Project**

-   [ ] **"Where did we got this idea?"**
-   [ ] Our visionary, **Liang**, connected with a **real entrepreneur** who  
        gave us a **real job**.
-   [ ] This is now set as our **internship**, and after that, we will continue as **part-time business partners.**
>
-   [ ] How the app works?
-   [ ] **Jeffrey** will show you what Bitamin **can do for you**.
-   [ ] I’ll hand you over to Jeffrey.

> ##### **Performance #2: The Final Thanks**
> *   **Action:** Dennis will advance to Slide #4.

> **Your Script:**
> "And we couldn't have done any of this without our amazing teachers, Christopher and Federica, and all our colleagues who supported us on this journey."
- [ ] i want to invite you now to our Q&A section. Feel free to raise your digital hand. Take in count that we invited friends and family 
- [ ] for today, who are not tech related. We please you to keep your questions in a simplified vocabulary, so that everyone can follow along.

*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Jeffrey's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Denis."
> *   **Action:** Resume screen sharing and display Slide #2.

> **Your Script:**

-   [ ] Thank you, Jeffrey. The front-end looks so clean and easy to use, doesn't it?
-   [ ] But now: **How does it all actually work?**
-   [ ] I could throw a bunch of *tech terms at you*, but that’s no fun. To make sure everyone understands our journey, *I'm going to explain 
        our team's work without tech terms* by taking you on a tour of our high-tech **bakery**.
> ...
-   [ ] *Imagine you are the customer, walking up to our bakery*. You see the beautiful **storefront** and the delicious-looking **cake** in 
        the window.
        That's our app's design. The master **Decorator** who made it all so inviting for you, was **Jeffrey**.
-   [ ] Now, a bakery needs to be a real business, right? It needs the lights on, the licenses paid, and a perfect system for quality control. 
        Our **Bakery Operations Manager**, who handling the administration and our automated delivery pipeline, was **Mariana**. 
-   [ ] So, who baked the cake? The bakers in the **kitchen**, that is my world. As **Head Baker**, my job was to manage our entire 'pantry'— 
        called the **database**,  where all the ingredients and recipes are stored.
-   [ ] I also defined where to receive the new orders, called API **endpoints**—so that the requests come in.
-   [ ] But how do you get a *complex order from the storefront* to the kitchen and an instantly back respond? That required a genius. 
        **Liang** was the inventor of our magic ordering system. He built the **APIs**—our 'waiters'—and more importantly, he created the 
        'universal translator'—the **serializers**—that turns a complex baked good into a simple ticket everyone can understand.


> ##### **Final Transition (Fading out to Liang)**

-   [ ] This was only possible because all parties worked in perfect harmony together.
-   [ ] But the most relevant story is *how* we grew as a team through this process.
-   [ ] To share that journey with you, I'll hand you over to the inventor of our magic ordering system, Liang.

> ## **Liang's Playbook**

> **Your Role:** You are the **Backend Baker** and the **Visionary**. Your job is to talk about the team's resilience and the exciting future of the project.


> ###### **Performance #1: Challenges & Future**

*   **Time Allotted:** 2min
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Denis's hand-off


> ##### **Introduction (Transition from Denis)**

-   [ ] Thank you, Denis. That bakery analogy was perfect.
-   [ ] So, I want to answer two simple questions for you all: **What’s next for our app?** And more importantly, 
        **how did this project change *us*?**


> ##### let's start: 

-   [ ] You might be wondering, what's the next feature?
-   [ ] Well, we want to make our traffic light system even smarter. Soon, it won't just tell you if you're getting enough of the good stuff—it will also **WARN** you about **too much of a good thing, like an overload of certain vitamins.**
-   [ ] On the other hand: We’re already **designing features for sharing your favorite nutrition plans with others**


> ##### So, Was It a Smooth Ride?

-   [ ] **Absolutely not.** 
-   [ ] We were so excited, nervous and inexperienced at the start that we jumped into coding without a perfect plan. 
-   [ ] **I definitely felt the pressure.** It made me realize, *"The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."*
-   [ ] **But here’s the secret:** Our *biggest success was the culture we built.*
-   [ ] We created a **"culture of doing mistakes,"**. As Mariana said, she **"lost her fears and gained self-confidence"** here.
-   [ ] That's what happens when you have a team with an **"open mind to talk about everything."** *That* was our **real magic ingredient.**
> ...
-   [ ] And speaking of the person who was so **central in talking about our vulnerabilities and strenghts,** I’ll hand it back to **Mariana** for the final words of this presentation:

> ## **Team Rehearsal Feedback**

``` ### **Feedback from Day 1 (Federica)**

> #### **Tasks for Mariana (@Mariana)**
-   [ ] **Intro:** In the introduction, state your specific role clearly, without using the analogy yet.
-   [ ] **Intro:** Add filtered profile pictures for each team member to the "roles" or "about us" section.
-   [ ] **Intro:** Add a brief overview of the application's "big picture" before transitioning to Jeffrey.
-   [ ] **Presentation Flow:** Refine the introduction sequence to cover:
    -   [ ] 1. Introduce the team with their roles and responsibilities.
    -   [ ] 2. Explain how the idea was developed and mention the product owner's role.
    -   [ ] 3. Give a high-level overview of the main features (nutrient info, ingredient search, light system, hydration tracking).
    -   [ ] 4. Create a smooth and clear transition for Jeffrey to begin the demo.

> #### **Tasks for Jeffrey (@jeffrey)**
-   [ ] **Content:** Write the script/text for your "About Us" section.
-   [ ] **Demo:** Create a static slide to simulate the user login process.
-   [ ] **Demo Pacing:** During the live demo, slow down and spend more time on each core functionality to ensure the audience understands it.
-   [ ] **Core Feature Demo:**
    -   [ ] Explain the difference between joining as a "Guest" vs. a "Registered" user.
    -   [ ] Clearly state the advantages of registering (e.g., viewing history, saving favorite recipes).
    -   [ ] When showing the nutrient charts, pause and emphasize their importance.
    -   [ ] Articulate *why* nutrient tracking is a useful and beneficial feature for the user.
    -   [ ] Demonstrate the search functionality with a clear example (e.g., searching for "tacos" or "beans").
    -   [ ] Show a final, complete recipe card as the outcome of a search.
    -   [ ] Show the "Contact Us" slide and confirm that the links are clickable and working.
    -   [ ] Demonstrate the light/dark mode color change feature.
-   [ ] **Co-ordination:**
    -   [ ] Plan and rehearse the search interaction part of the demo with @Mariana.

> #### **Tasks for Denis (@Denis)**
-   [ ] **Presentation:** Keep your technical explanation simple and focused on the "bakery/kitchen" analogy.

#### **Tasks for Liang (@Liang)**
-   [ ] **Presentation:** Prepare simple, clear slides for the "Future Features" section.
-   [ ] **Future Features:** During your section, mention the plan to track vitamin safety/overload using the traffic light system visual.
-   [ ] **Team Learnings:** Prepare to talk about the new skills the team learned individually. Be sure to highlight:
    -   `Mariana`: Learned about Agile systems, writing pipelines, using advanced GitHub/GitLab features, coordinating sprints, and writing presentation pitches/playbooks. Also served a key role in research to support bug fixing.
    -   `Jeffrey`: Learned new languages and frameworks including HTML, CSS, and Java.
    -   `Liang`: Researched and implemented different libraries to improve server stability.
    -   `Denis`: Mastered Django's complexities, finding workarounds for its unpredictable behavior. He successfully restructured the database when new features required it and learned to optimize data fetching (e.g., using pagination and caching).
-   [ ] **Team Lead/Retrospective:** Lead a discussion and prepare to talk about the team's challenges and growth.
    -   **Key Themes and Quotes to Include:**
        -   **Initial Challenges:** "We were too exciting in coding, rather than having a plan," "biggest problem was to have a project owner and never talked about the key functions from the beginning," and a general "lack of communication about how the app should look."
        -   **Emotional Journey:** Talk about the initial feelings of being "nervous," "inexperienced," and "clueless," which led to struggles with the data approach and a "lack of clarity."
        -   **Individual Struggles & Growth:**
            -   Mention Denis's frustration with the "fix and fix and try again" cycle of debugging.
            -   Share your own feeling of pressure as team lead, the overestimation of performance, and the realization: *"The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."*
        -   **Positive Outcomes & Key Learnings:**
            -   Highlight Mariana's journey: "I lost my fears. Gained self-confidence."
            -   Emphasize the importance of the team environment: **"Support and an open mind to talk about everything,"** **"The culture of doing mistakes,"** and having a **"non-violent, funny, supportive"** atmosphere was crucial for success.

> #### **Tasks for Backend Team (@Backend_Team)**
-   [ ] **Future Features:** Plan the backend architecture for future registered-user features:
    -   [ ] Comparison between selected ingredients.
    -   [ ] Individual recipe configuration.

> ### **Feedback from Day 2**

*   **Federica suggested that:**
     timing ... intro too long. Get a flow when reading. Do not worry if we
    forget to talk something.
    Not a long handover with roadmap, also a transition faster, just for
    Jeffrey part a transition. 
    Jeffrey cut not on what showing, cut technical things, like requests.
    At the end just hand out to Jeffrey without saying a long time
    Linag shouls not repeat the analogy of the roles, Denis did already.
