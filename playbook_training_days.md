*   **Your Cue:** The presentation begins. You are the first speaker.
*   **Action:** Dennis will have Slide #1 displayed.

> **Your Script:**
> "Good morning. What if your nutrition app was for more than just weight loss?
>
> What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?
>
> This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.
>
> We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.
>
> We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana.
>
> **And now, I'll hand you over to Jeffrey** to show you exactly how it works."

## **Jeffrey's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Pâtissier / Decorator** and the **User's Guide**. Your job is to own the live demo and moderate the Q&A.

#### **Performance #1: The Live Demo**
*   **Time Allotted:** 7 minutes
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Jeffrey."
*   **Action:** Start your screen share.

> **Your Script:**
> Thank you, Mariana. For today, you will imagine that I'm talking to a Grandma as our official app tester. So, please imagine that I am presenting this just for her, she must be able to spread the word to her friends.
>
> *(Shifts tone to be warmer, more personal)*
>
> Hey Grandma, this app will make your life much easier. Think of it as a smart recipe book that knows you personally.
>
> This is an intelligent cookbook and a nutrition consultant with a tracking function: First, you create a profile. *(Shows the sign-up form)*. This just means you give us your basic data, like your name and age, and the app will remember you every time you visit. It's like having your own personalized kitchen files.
>
> Once you're in, the magic happens. Every time you tell the app what you ate—let's say an avocado for lunch—it will be saved. At the end of the day, you can look at your dashboard *(this is the dashboard .... )* and see if your meals were good, healthy, or if they could be improved.
>
> And how do you know? We made a very simple light system, just like the traffic lights you know so well. *(Points to the charts on the screen)*
> * Green stands for a good decision—you're getting enough of the good stuff!
> * Yellow is for precaution—you're on your way, but could use a little more.
> * Red is a red flag—a gentle hint that you might be having too much of something.
>
> No judgment, just simple guidance.
>
> So, in this first version of the app, you can do four amazing things:
> 1. You can track the quality of your meals. You can see your history for the day, the week, the month, and even the whole year to see how you're improving.
> 2. You can actively search our database or lets call it dictionary. Curious what's in a potato? Just type it in. Or, if you need more Magnesium, you can search for 'Magnesium' and see all the foods that contain it.
> 3. Grandma, you must drink enough water! This app helps you track your hydration. With every glass, you just click this button... *(Clicks the water icon and the chart animates)* ...and the chart fills up. It's that easy.
>
> And coming soon, we will have automated recipes based on your unique nutritional needs to help you achieve your goals even faster.
>
> Now, we want to explain how we built this app. But to not make it complicated for you, Grandma, we will talk in your language. Instead of being software developers, for today, we are in a bakery. The app is our cake. I was the 'decorator,' making the app look good for you. But a beautiful cake needs a great team of bakers and a well-run store. To explain how it all came together, I'll hand you over to Denis.

#### **Performance #2: Q&A Moderation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 35 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana to finish her final thank you.
*   **Action:** Dennis will switch to the Q&A slide.

> **Your Script:**
> "And now, we'd love to open the floor for any questions. To make sure we have time for everyone, we'll take one question per person, and we have five minutes total for this block. We also kindly ask that you keep questions simple, so that friends and family can follow along. We promise to answer in the same simple language. **Thank you, and who has the first question?**"

## **Denis's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Architect** and the **Slide Master**. Your job is to make the technical explanation simple and ensure the visual flow is perfect.

#### **Performance #1: The Technical Explanation**
*   **Time Allotted:** 45 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Jeffrey's hand-off: "...I'll hand you over to Denis."
*   **Action:** Resume screen sharing and display Slide #2.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Jeffrey. As he said, to create this app, our bakery had three main working spaces.
>
> First, in the **kitchen**, our bakers—Liang and I—planned the app's structure. For this, we used powerful 'appliances' like **Django** and **PostgreSQL**.
>
> Second, in the **pâtisserie**, our decorator Jeffrey made the cake look beautiful using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
>
> And third, at the **store**, Mariana managed the entire operation—logistics, customer care, and the delivery pipeline—using systems like **Jira, GitHub Projects, and a CI/CD Pipeline**.
>
> **And now, Liang will talk about our challenges and what's next for the bakery.**"

## **Liang's Playbook & Worksheet**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Baker** and the **Visionary**. Your job is to talk about the team's resilience and the exciting future of the project.

#### **Performance #1: Challenges & Future**
*   **Time Allotted:** 30 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Denis's hand-off: "...Liang will talk about our challenges..."
*   **Action:** Dennis will advance to Slide #3.

> **Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Denis. Our biggest challenge was hiding all the complexity. Making something feel this simple took a lot of late nights to pass our 'Grandma Test.'
>
> But those challenges prepared us for the future. Our next steps are to build a custom recipe creator, use AI for personalized meal plans, and launch on the app stores."

*   **Federica suggested that:**
*   Mariana: 
    In the introduction add the role, without analogy.
    Pictures from ourselves for the roles. <--- filtered ones
    - some few words about the big picture of the application, before transition to
    Jeffrey
    1. introduce the team with the roles and responsabilites
    2. how the idea was develope, about the product owner
    3. talk about the main functionality in a big picture all the W-Questions (Feaures: micro / macro explain - ingridients's nutrients 
       information, what is inside of 
       an ingredient, look ingredients based on a nutrient, light system to handle it easier, plus hydration)
    4. now Jeffrey will demostrate how this works:
    - add about us text for @jeffrey

    Jeffrey: *write on scrip
    - simulate a log in --> this will be a slide /static *maybe Django adjustments
    - stay on every functionality a bit longer
      CORE: 
    - explain that you can join as a guest vs register : why? advantages: history,
      favorite recipes saving (which else for the future? ´@backend : comparison between selected ingredients, recipes indiviual configuration, sharing with other users and in social media, feed section)
      GOAL:
      *stay on nutrients charts*
      - mencioned that in the future tracking of safty and dangerous overload of vitamines. Simple visuals 
      with light traffic system
      *mencioned later this by @liang with the chart open* --> static about charts
    - why are nutrients tracking useful?
    - interaction of searching about something filtering @mariana @jeffrey. Ex: tacos, beans...
    - show final recipe
    - show contact slide --> show the working one and is clickable /static
    - change of color light to dark mode
 
    Denis:
    FOCUS:
    - keep it simple
    - analogy of the kitchen
    - add java script / delete bootstrap


    Liang:
    FOCUS:
    - on the future features, but with simple slides for it * check notes above @jeffrey
    - on the new skills we learned by ourselves (Jeffrey: html, css, java, Liang: different libraries to
      improve the server stability, Denis: Django causes weird issues, find round
      about ways to solve it. Database structure, when adding a new feature
      it was not suficcient. Fetching json storing excesive data (pagination, cache)
      Denis: models - Django is difficult when interacting. Primary keys are asign
      automatically and when writing own, behaviour will fail.
      Following the documentation not really worked as expected.
      all: fix new bugs, unknow texts
      
    - challeges working as a groups:
      * we were to exciting in coding, rather having a plan and how to put everything together
      * biggest problem was to have a project owner and never talked about the key functions from the 
        beggining
      * lack of communication about how the app should look, what we wanted to track, ways to track
      * ways to visualize, lack of communication about it
      * we designed the users epics and stories, but we forgot to plan the app architecture in detail, 
        dividing it in 4 big chunks, functionality: backend, frontend, api's endpoints, pipline
      * next step write skelletons and pseudocodes for each section.

            Why this happened to us?
        - nervousity
        - unexperience
        - helpless
        - clueless
        - struggle with approach for the data
        - lack of control
        - lack of clarity and the vision got lost, lead to re-iterations on the flight
       
          how do we continue the process?
        - ups and downs
        - struggling learning technologies by self-learning
        - time pressure, too many holidays (for Jeffrey, family time)
        - mondays, language lessons took more time from us. Better no language course the last month or soft 
          skills . Stresses a lot, makes us tired and we need the time and energy for coding. 4.0 was the 
          biggest shit
        - taking the role of the team leader (liang), felt not making good progress, helping everyone where
          it was needed. Lack of satisfaction. About own expectations, where high. Overestimation of own 
          performance. Thought "i am not good engough" "The more i know, the more i realise i know nothing" 
          Socrates.
        - pressure in holidays to learn more tutorials
        - previous personal experiences of others expecting more about you. We think about @liang as an 
          expert
        - Denis: frustration, code breaks continously, impredictable bevaviour from Django. Fix and Fix and 
          try again.
        - Support and open mind to talk about everything
        - Mariana: i lost my fears. Gain Selfconfidence. Being an assitence was great, little steps. No 
          judgment, no pressure for tech topics. The culture of doing mistakes. Motivation. Many breaks
          Emotional understanding, non-violent, funny. Supportive. Watching the backend fix bugs, was a 
          great teaching
    
*   **Christopher suggested that:**
Key points:
- flow in changing speaker
- give the croud the feeling what is coming next, give a short description about 
  what the next speaker will talk about
- more practice
- work on smooth dynamics
- introduction more catchy
- show more about our application
