### **Mariana's Introduction Script (The Final Version - 2 Min)**

> **(Instructions for Mariana: This is it. Deliver with the passion of a founder who is proud of both the product and the team behind it. Click the checkbox after each point.)**

> ##### **Part 1: The Pitch & The "Bitamin" Philosophy**

-   [ ] Good morning every one. Question: Are you overwhelmed by the flood of nutrition advice on social media? Your Instagram says one thing, your TikTok says the complete opposite, and you're left wondering what's actually right for *you*.
-   [ ] And let's be honest almost every nutrition app out there asks you to count calories, as health was just about losing weight.
-   [ ] Studies show that’s just wrong; Here our solution:
-   [ ] We created **Bitamin**.
-   [ ] The name is our entire philosophy: a fusion of **Bit**—the smallest unit of data, and **Amin**—from amino acids, the fundamental building blocks of life. Improving your health isn't about dieting; it's about understanding your body needs and your individual goals.

---

> ##### **Part 2: Why Bitamin is Different & Who We Are**

-   [ ] Bitamin is not another calorie counter. It is a **quality** individual nutrient tracker for micro and macro nutrients
-   [ ] It gives you a colored signal on a chart using the simple traffic light system we all understand: green, yellow, and red, to know if 
        you are talking enough good stuff for yourself or not.
-   [ ] Because *your* goals are unique, maybe you want to improve your gut health, manage an allergy, or sleep deeper. Bitamin is designed to 
        help you track the nutrients in each meal so you can finally make informed decisions at the grocery shop, restaurants and daily life.
-   [ ] So, who is the team behind Bitamin?
-   [ ] Our backend and app functionality creators are **Liang** and **Denis**.
-   [ ] Our frontend artist, who created a fusion of minimalistic American and retro art, is **Jeffrey**, taking care that the design stays clean and simple.
-   [ ] And for the logistics, administration of processes, and tracking everything possible—that’s me, **Mariana**.


> ##### **Part 3: The Story of Our Project**

-   [ ] Now that you know the team, you might be thinking, "Where did this incredible idea come from?"
-   [ ] This journey began when our visionary, **Liang**, connected with a real entrepreneur who needed a team to build this app. He didn't 
        give us a homework assignment; he gave us a **job**.
-   [ ] This project is now set to become our internship, and after that, we plan to continue as part-time business partners.


> ##### **Part 4: The Roadmap & Transition**

-   [ ] So, are you curious to see how the app works?
-   [ ] Over the next few minutes, you will be taken on a full journey.
-   [ ] First, **Jeffrey** will show you what Bitamin **can do for you**.
-   [ ] I’ll hand you over to Jeffrey.

### **Denis's Presentation Script (The Precise Bakery Analogy - 90 Sec)**

#####  **Introduction (Fading in from Jeffrey)**

-   [ ] Thank you, Jeffrey. What you just saw looks so clean and easy to use, doesn't it?
-   [ ] But now for the big question: **How does it all actually work?**
-   [ ] I could throw a bunch of tech terms at you, but that’s no fun. To make sure everyone understands our journey, I'm going to explain our team's work by taking you on a tour of our high-tech **bakery**.
> ...
-   [ ] Imagine you are the customer. You walk up to our bakery. You see the beautiful **storefront** and the delicious-looking **cake** in the window. That's our app's design. The master **Decorator** who made it all so inviting for you? That was **Jeffrey**.
-   [ ] Now, a bakery needs to be a real business, right? It needs the lights on, the licenses paid, and a perfect system for quality control. Our **Bakery Operations Manager**, who handled all the administration and even built our automated delivery pipeline, was **Mariana**. She made sure the entire operation ran flawlessly.
-   [ ] So, where does the cake itself come from? That's the **kitchen**, my world. As **Head Baker**, my job was to manage our entire 'pantry'—the **database** where all the ingredients and recipes are stored. I also built the 'doors' to the kitchen—the **endpoints**—so orders could come in.
-   [ ] But how do you get a complex order from the storefront to the kitchen and back again instantly? That required a genius. **Liang** was the inventor of our magic ordering system. He built the **APIs**—our 'waiters'—and more importantly, he created the 'universal translator'—the **serializers**—that turns a complex baked good into a simple ticket everyone can understand.


> ##### **Final Transition (Fading out to Liang)**

-   [ ] So, the simple, beautiful cake you see is only possible because a decorator, a manager, a baker, and an inventor all worked in perfect harmony.
-   [ ] But the most important story isn't just *what* each of us built, but *how* we grew as a team through that process.
-   [ ] To share that journey with you, I'll hand you over to the inventor of our magic ordering system, Liang.

## **Liang's Playbook**

**Your Role:** You are the **Backend Baker** and the **Visionary**. Your job is to talk about the team's resilience and the exciting future of the project.


### **Performance #1: Challenges & Future**

*   **Time Allotted:** 2min
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Denis's hand-off

### **Liang's Presentation Script (Dynamic & Catchy Version)**


#### **Introduction (Transition from Denis)**

-   [ ] Thank you, Denis. That bakery analogy was perfect.
-   [ ] So, with the cake now built, I want to answer two simple questions for you all: **What’s next for our app?** And more importantly, **how did this project change *us*?**

---

> #### **Where Do We Go From Here?**

-   [ ] Let's start with what's next. You might be wondering, what's the next big feature?
-   [ ] Well, we want to make our traffic light system even smarter. Soon, it won't just tell you if you're getting enough of the good stuff—it will also warn you about too much of a good thing, like an overload of certain vitamins.
-   [ ] And of course, we want to bring people together. We’re already designing features for sharing your favorite recipes and creating truly personal meal plans.

---

> #### **How Did We Actually Pull This Off?**

-   [ ] That's the *what*. But the *how* is even more interesting. This project was a massive challenge, and every single one of us had to level up.
-   [ ] **Mariana?** She was the glue that held our team together. She became our project manager, our pipeline builder, and our lead researcher, guiding us through the tough spots.
-   [ ] **Jeffrey** became our artist. He taught himself the languages of the web—HTML, CSS, JavaScript—to create the beautiful, simple design you saw.
-   [ ] **Denis** became the tamer of the beast that is Django. He wrestled with the code, completely rebuilt our database, and made our app run lightning-fast.
-   [ ] And **me?** I was the engineer in the engine room, finding new ways to make our server stable and fast, no matter what we threw at it.

---

> #### So, Was It a Smooth Ride?**

-   [ ] **Absolutely not.** And that’s the most important part of our story.
-   [ ] We were so excited at the start that we jumped into coding without a perfect plan. We felt nervous, we felt inexperienced.
-   [ ] I definitely felt the pressure. It made me realize, *"The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."*
-   [ ] **But here’s the secret:** Our biggest success wasn't the code. It was the culture we built.
-   [ ] We created a **"culture of doing mistakes,"** where everyone had a voice. As Mariana said, she **"lost her fears and gained self-confidence"** here.
-   [ ] That's what happens when you have a team with an **"open mind to talk about everything."** *That* was our real magic ingredient.

---
> ...
-   [ ] And speaking of the person who was so central in talking about our vulnerabilities and strenghts, I’ll hand it back to Mariana for the final words of this presentation:

### **Feedback from Day 2**

*   **Federica suggested that:**
     timing ... intro too long. Get a flow when reading. Do not worry if we
    forget to talk something.
    Not a long handover with roadmap, also a transition faster, just for
    Jeffrey part a transition. 
    Jeffrey cut not on what showing, cut technical things, like requests.
    At the end just hand out to Jeffrey without saying a long time
    Linag shouls not repeat the analogy of the roles, Denis did already.
