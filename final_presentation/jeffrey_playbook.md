### **Performance #1: The Live Demo**

*   **Time Allotted:** 7 minutes
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana's hand-off: "...And now, to show you what we've baked, I'll hand it over to Jeffrey."
*   **Action:** Start your screen share.

**Your Script:**
> "Thank you, Mariana. For today, you will imagine that I've invited my Grandma to be our official app tester. So, please imagine that I am presenting this just for her.
>
> *(Shift tone to be warmer, more personal)*
>
> Hey Grandma, this is a nutrition tracker for all your macro and micro nutrients—like Magnesium, amino acids, proteins, calcium, and all kinds of vitamins... *(...continue with the full demo script as practiced...)* ...See? The chart fills up to show your progress. It's that easy.
>
> Now, we want to explain how we built this app. But to not make it complicated for you, Grandma, we will talk in your language. Instead of being software developers, for today, we are a **bakery**. The app is our cake. I was the 'decorator,' making the app look good for you. But a beautiful cake needs a great team of bakers and a well-run store. **To explain how it all came together, I'll hand you over to Denis.**"

### **Performance #2: Q&A Moderation**

*   **Time Allotted:** 35 seconds
*   **Your Cue:** Listen for Mariana to finish her final thank you.
*   **Action:** Dennis will switch to the Q&A slide.

**Your Script:**
> "And now, we'd love to open the floor for any questions. To make sure we have time for everyone, we'll take one question per person, and we have five minutes total for this block. We also kindly ask that you keep questions simple, so that friends and family can follow along. We promise to answer in the same simple language. **Thank you, and who has the first question?**"

## **Your Personal Worksheet**

#### **1. Performance & Reflection**

*   **Question:** The "Grandma" persona is key. What specific words or tones will you use to make it feel genuine and not like a caricature?

*   **Question:** In the demo, where can you add a small pause or a rhetorical question ("Simple, right?") to make it feel more interactive?

    ________________________________________________________________

#### **2. Technical Preparation**

*   **Question:** What is your **emergency backup plan** if the live demo site fails? (e.g., pre-recorded video, static screenshots).

    ________________________________________________________________
    ________________________________________________________________

*   **Question:** What is the one feature you MUST show, and what is one you could cut if you are running out of time?
