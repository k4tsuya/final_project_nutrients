#### **Introduction (Fading in from Jeffrey)**

-   [ ] Thank you, Jeffrey. What you just saw looks so clean and easy to use, doesn't it?
-   [ ] But now for the big question: **How does it all actually work?**
-   [ ] I could throw a bunch of tech terms at you, but that’s no fun. To make sure everyone understands our journey, I'm going to explain our team's work by taking you on a tour of our high-tech **bakery**.

#### **The Customer's Journey & Our Expert Team**

-   [ ] Imagine you are the customer. You walk up to our bakery. You see the beautiful **storefront** and the delicious-looking **cake** in the window. That's our app's design. The master **Decorator** who made it all so inviting for you? That was **Jeffrey**.
-   [ ] Now, a bakery needs to be a real business, right? It needs the lights on, the licenses paid, and a perfect system for quality control. Our **Bakery Operations Manager**, who handled all the administration and even built our automated delivery pipeline, was **Mariana**. She made sure the entire operation ran flawlessly.
-   [ ] So, where does the cake itself come from? That's the **kitchen**, my world. As **Head Baker**, my job was to manage our entire 'pantry'—the **database** where all the ingredients and recipes are stored. I also built the 'doors' to the kitchen—the **endpoints**—so orders could come in.
-   [ ] But how do you get a complex order from the storefront to the kitchen and back again instantly? That required a genius. **Liang** was the inventor of our magic ordering system. He built the **APIs**—our 'waiters'—and more importantly, he created the 'universal translator'—the **serializers**—that turns a complex baked good into a simple ticket everyone can understand.

#### **Final Transition (Fading out to Liang)**

-   [ ] So, the simple, beautiful cake you see is only possible because a decorator, a manager, a baker, and an inventor all worked in perfect harmony.
-   [ ] But the most important story isn't just *what* each of us built, but *how* we grew as a team through that process.
-   [ ] To share that journey with you, I'll hand you over to the inventor of our magic ordering system, Liang.

## **Your Personal Worksheet**

#### **1. Performance & Reflection**

*   **Question:** Your section is the most technical. How will you use your voice to make the analogies ("kitchen," "pâtisserie," "store") the main point, so the audience isn't intimidated by the tech words?

*   **Question:** Practice your part with a timer. Can you deliver it clearly and confidently within the 45-second window without rushing the technology names?

#### **2. Technical Preparation (Crucial for you)**

*   **Question:** As the **"Slide Master,"** what is your plan for the screen-share handoff with Jeffrey? Have you rehearsed it? (You stop sharing, he starts, then he stops, and you  ________________________________________________________________

*   **Question:** Do you have the Q&A appendix slides ready? Practice jumping to a specific backup slide (like the PostgreSQL logo) quickly and confidently.
