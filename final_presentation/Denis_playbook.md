**Your Script:**
> "Thanks, Jeffrey. As he said, to create this app, our bakery had three main working spaces.
>
> First, in the **kitchen**, our bakers—Liang and I—planned the app's structure. For this, we used powerful 'appliances' like **Django** and **PostgreSQL**.
>
> Second, in the **pâtisserie**, our decorator Jeffrey made the cake look beautiful using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.
>
> And third, at the **store**, Mariana managed the entire operation—logistics, customer care, and the delivery pipeline—using systems like **Jira, GitHub Projects, and a CI/CD Pipeline**.
>
> **And now, Liang will talk about our challenges and what's next for the bakery.**"

## **Your Personal Worksheet**

#### **1. Performance & Reflection**

*   **Question:** Your section is the most technical. How will you use your voice to make the analogies ("kitchen," "pâtisserie," "store") the main point, so the audience isn't intimidated by the tech words?

*   **Question:** Practice your part with a timer. Can you deliver it clearly and confidently within the 45-second window without rushing the technology names?

#### **2. Technical Preparation (Crucial for you)**

*   **Question:** As the **"Slide Master,"** what is your plan for the screen-share handoff with Jeffrey? Have you rehearsed it? (You stop sharing, he starts, then he stops, and you resume).

*   **Question:** Do you have the Q&A appendix slides ready? Practice jumping to a specific backup slide (like the PostgreSQL logo) quickly and confidently.
