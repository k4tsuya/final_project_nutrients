# **Final Playbook: "BITAMINE" Tracking (Final Version)**





### **Part 1: The Intro (~1 minute, 30 seconds)**

*(Slide 1: GOAL OF THE APP is showing. It could be the logo with the tagline "Your Personal Recipe for Wellness")*

"Good morning. What if your nutrition app was for more than just weight loss?

What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?

This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.

We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.

We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana.

And now, I'll hand you over to Jeffrey to show you exactly how it works."

### **Part 2: The Core - Live Demo (~7 minutes)**

"Thank you, Mariana. For today, you will imagine that I've invited my Grandma to be our official app tester. So, please imagine that I am presenting this just for her.

*(Shifts tone to be warmer, more personal)*

Hey Grandma, this is a nutrition tracker for all your macro and micro nutrients—like Magnesium, amino acids, proteins, calcium, and all kinds of vitamins.

You can search in two powerful ways. First, you can enter a food like 'potato' and see what's inside it. Or, the other way around, you can type 'Magnesium' and see all the foods that contain it.

I'll explain the functions in Grandma-friendly language:

First, after you log in, you land on this simple dashboard. Let's say you search for 'avocado' for your lunch. The app instantly shows you its nutritional value. The most important part is our simple color guide: green is great, amber means you're on your way, and red is just a gentle hint.

When we researched other apps, they were all about weight loss. Our goal is to *educate*. We save you exhausting research time. For example, how much of a vitamin is too much? Our app signals that with the red color, keeping things simple and safe.

Oh, and Grandma, you must drink enough water! I'll show you how to remember if you're hydrating yourself well. *(Clicks the water icon and the chart animates)*. See? The chart fills up to show your progress. It's that easy.

Now, we want to explain how we built this app. But to not make it complicated for you, Grandma, we will talk in your language. Instead of being software developers, for today, we are a **bakery**. The app is our cake. I was the 'decorator,' making the app look good for you. But a beautiful cake needs a great team of bakers and a well-run store. To explain how it all came together, I'll hand you over to Denis."

### **Part 3: The Outro (~2 minutes, 30 seconds)**
*(Jeffrey stops sharing, Dennis starts sharing his screen again)*

`[08:30 - 09:15]` ``@Dennis``
*(Dennis shows Slide 2: THE BAKERY TEAM / TECHNOLOGIES)*
"Thanks, Jeffrey. As he said, to create this app, our bakery had three main working spaces.
First, in the **kitchen**, our bakers—Liang and I—planned the app's structure. For this, we used powerful 'appliances' like **Django** and **PostgreSQL**.

Second, in the **pâtisserie**, our decorator Jeffrey made the cake look beautiful using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.

And third, at the **store**, Mariana managed the entire operation—logistics, customer care, and the delivery pipeline—using systems like **Jira, GitHub Projects, and a CI/CD Pipeline**.

And now, Liang will talk about our challenges and what's coming next for the app... look at it."

`[09:15 - 09:45]` ``@Liang``
*(Dennis advances to Slide 3: CHALLENGES & FUTURE)*
"Thanks, Denis. Our biggest challenge was hiding all the complexity. Making something feel this simple took a lot of late nights to pass our 'Grandma Test.' But those challenges prepared us for the future. Our next steps are to build a custom recipe creator, use AI for personalized meal plans, based on your individual nutritions goals, also tracking of your eating behavour short, middle, long term. We give you a compass to be full in control of your meals and to achieve your personal goals and launch on the app stores and google play."

`[09:45 - 10:10]` ``@Mariana``
*(Dennis advances to Slide 4: FINAL THANKS)*
"Guys, i guess that we are now software developers , lol. And we couldn't have done any of this without our amazing teachers. On behalf of all of us, thank you to our Christopher and Federica, and to all our colleagues who supported us on this journey and to the DCI TEAM. Thank you !"

`[10:10 - 10:45]` ``@Jeffrey``
*(Dennis advances to Slide 5: Q&A)*
"And now, we'd love to open the floor for any questions. To make sure we have time for everyone, we'll take one question per person, and we have five minutes total for this block. We also kindly ask that you keep questions simple, so that friends and family can follow along. We promise to answer in the same simple language. Thank you, and who has the first question?"
