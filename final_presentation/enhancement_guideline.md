Excellent. These are critical refinements that will make your Q&A session incredibly professional and demonstrate foresight. Handling unknown questions gracefully is a key soft skill, and having specific future-feature slides ready is very impressive.

Here is the finalized `enhancement_guideline.md` with all your latest updates, including the corrected tech stack, the strategy for unknown questions, and the new, more detailed backup slides.

# **Presentation Enhancement Guideline (`enhancement_guideline.md`)**

**Purpose:** This document bridges the gap between our script (`playbook.md`) and our live performance. It provides a clear strategy for executing our presentation smoothly, confidently, and creatively, ensuring we meet all enhancement criteria.

**(Sections 1-4 remain the same)**

## **5. Be Creative and Make Your Presentation Vivid**

## **6. Managing the Q&A Session**

To ensure the Q&A is efficient, fair, and respects everyone's time, we will use a dedicated slide with clear rules.

#### **The Q&A Slide Strategy:**

*   **When:** After ``@Jeffrey`` concludes the presentation, ``@Dennis`` will display this slide.
*   **Purpose:** To politely and professionally set expectations before the first question is asked.
*   **Content:** The slide will be super-minimalistic, containing only the following:

> ### **Q&A**
>
> ---
>
> *   **Total Time:** 5 Minutes
> *   **Format:** One Question per Person
>
> ---
>
> #### üëµ Remember the Grandma Test!
> *Please keep questions clear and concise for our mixed audience.*

*   **Visual Suggestion:** A small, friendly icon of a grandma or a simple lightbulb next to the "Remember the Grandma Test!" text to reinforce the theme.
