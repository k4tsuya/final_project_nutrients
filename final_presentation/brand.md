## **2. Visual Identity: Our "Look"**

*   **Logo:**
    *   **Symbolism:** It cleverly combines an organic fruit/food shape with a data-driven pie chart. The leaves signify natural health and growth. It perfectly represents our fusion of nature and technology.

    *   **Background:** `Charcoal` (#303030) - A dark, modern, and focused backdrop that makes the accent colors pop.
    *   **Primary Text & Elements:** `Off-White` (#F2F2F2) - For clean, readable text and primary icons.
    *   **Accent 1 (Primary):** `Sage Green` (#879E83) - Used for primary call-to-actions, highlights, and positive chart segments. Evokes nature and calm.
