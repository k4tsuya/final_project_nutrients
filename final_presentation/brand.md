## **1. Core Identity: Our "Why"**

*   **Brand Mission:** To make personal wellness simple, visual, and encouraging for everyone, moving beyond the stress of calorie counting.
*   **Brand Vision:** A world where people feel empowered—not intimidated—by their health data, leading to more balanced and joyful lives.
*   **Core Values:**
    *   **Simplicity:** We hide complexity to provide clarity.
    *   **Encouragement:** We use positive framing and visual feedback.
    *   **Trust:** We are transparent and protect user data.
    *   **Education:** We empower users to understand their own unique nutritional needs.

## **2. Visual Identity: Our "Look"**

*   **Logo:**
    
    *   **Symbolism:** It cleverly combines an organic fruit/food shape with a data-driven pie chart. The leaves signify natural health and growth. It perfectly represents our fusion of nature and technology.

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** `Sage Green` (#8FA893) - Used for primary elements and backgrounds. Evokes nature, calm, and health.
    *   **Secondary:** `Muted Orange` (#E0A05B) - Used as a highlight color for charts and call-to-action buttons. Evokes energy and vibrancy.
    *   **Accent:** `Terracotta Red` (#C0573A) - Used sparingly for important alerts or chart segments. Evokes earthiness and focus.
    *   **Background:** `Charcoal Black` (#232625) - Provides a high-contrast, modern, and focused backdrop for the colors to pop.

*   **Typography:**
    *   **Headings Font:** A clean, rounded sans-serif font (e.g., Poppins, Nunito). It should feel modern, friendly, and approachable.
    *   **Body Font:** A highly readable, simple sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Lato). The priority is clarity and ease of reading.

## **3. Voice & Tone: Our "Feel"**

*   **Our Voice Is (Who we are):**
    *   **A Friendly Guide:** Knowledgeable but never arrogant. We explain things simply.
    *   **An Encouraging Coach:** We celebrate progress and frame data positively.
    *   **A Trustworthy Friend:** We are honest, direct, and respectful of privacy.

*   **Our Tone Is (How we speak):**
    *   **The "Grandma Test":** Always simple, warm, and clear. If Grandma wouldn't understand it, we rewrite it.
    *   **Analogies Welcome:** We embrace our "Bake-Off" theme. We explain tech concepts using simple, relatable stories about kitchens, recipes, and waiters.
    *   **Avoid:** Corporate jargon, complex technical terms, and language related to guilt or restriction.
