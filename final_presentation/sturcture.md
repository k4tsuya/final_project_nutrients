Hey guys,

this is the map to our playbook, ensuring all presentation requirements are met within the finals presentation structure. It provides a quick reference for who is speaking, when, and what visual aids are needed. This are just some suggestions ( ``@Jeffrey``  letś check it out later on).

Here is the `structure.md` file, formatted and ready to use.

# **Presentation Structure Map (`structure.md`)**

This document maps the official presentation requirements to the "BITAMINE: The Bake-Off" playbook. It serves as a checklist to ensure all key points are covered during the presentation.

---

## **1. Introduce Your Project**

### **a. What is the idea of your project and the motivation behind it?**
*   **Covered in:** [Preamble: Setting the Stage](playbook.md#preamble-setting-the-stage)
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Mariana`` (sets the stage), ``@Liang`` (explains the core philosophy), ``@Mariana`` (describes the client challenge).
*   **Timeline:** `[02:45 - 03:15]` and `[03:55 - 04:30]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** The presentation opens with the core theme. The "real client" story provides the core motivation and sets up the project's ambitious scope.
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** A powerful split-screen image. On the left, a beautifully crafted cake. On the right, a screen with elegant code. The text "If you can cook, you can code." is centered over both.
    2.  **Slide:** A simple, bold question on a clean background: `"What do baking and software development have in common?"` that stays up while Liang explains the philosophy.

### **b. Which problems does it solve and what relevance does it have?**
*   **Covered in:** [Preamble: Setting the Stage](playbook.md#preamble-setting-the-stage)
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Liang``
*   **Timeline:** `[03:25 - 03:55]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** Liang directly addresses the gap in the market—the focus on weight loss vs. overall wellness—and explains why a new approach is relevant today.
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** A word cloud of negative terms associated with traditional dieting (`calories`, `restrictive`, `guilt`, `failure`). As Liang speaks, these words fade out and are replaced by positive terms (`energy`, `strength`, `wellness`, `balance`).
    2.  **Slide:** An illustration of a sad-looking person on a weight scale, which then transitions to an image of a vibrant, energetic person hiking or enjoying a healthy meal.

### **c. What is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of your project?**
*   **Covered in:** [Preamble: Setting the Stage](playbook.md#preamble-setting-the-stage) and [Chapter 3: The Secret Sauce](playbook.md#chapter-3-the-secret-sauce-and-a-clever-name---the-invisible-bridge)
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Liang``
*   **Timeline:** `[03:25 - 03:55]` (for the app's goal) and `[08:10 - 08:30]` (for the brand's meaning).
*   **Presentation Cues:** The USP is twofold: the app's *function* (simple, visual wellness tracking beyond weight) and its *brand identity* (BITAMINE as digital building blocks for health).
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** A side-by-side comparison. On the left, a screenshot of a cluttered, number-heavy calorie-counting app. On the right, a clean, beautiful mockup of BITAMINE's simple, color-coded dashboard.
    2.  **Slide:** The **BITAMINE** logo with an animated breakdown showing "BIT" -> "Technology" and "AMINE" -> "Amino Acids / Building Blocks."

## **2. Present Your Team**

### **a. Show your names and photos to the presentation.**
*   **Covered in:** [Preamble: Setting the Stage](playbook.md#preamble-setting-the-stage)
*   **Speaker(s):** The entire team is introduced and speaks sequentially.
*   **Timeline:** `[00:00 - 02:45]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** The opening slide should feature the team. Each member gets a moment in the spotlight as they answer Mariana's opening questions.
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** A clean "Meet the Chefs" slide with professional headshots, names, and a one-word title under each (e.g., Mariana: *The Vision*, Dennis: *The Architect*, Jeffrey: *The Artist*, Liang: *The Philosopher*).
    2.  **Slide:** A dynamic opening slide where each person's photo and name is highlighted as they are introduced.

### **b. Who had which role in your team? How did you split the tasks and why?**
*   **Covered in:** [Chapter 1: The Engine Room](playbook.md#chapter-1-the-engine-room---the-unseen-grind)
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Jeffrey`` (as Host)
*   **Timeline:** `[04:35 - 05:05]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** This is explicitly covered when Jeffrey defines the technical terms using the kitchen analogy, assigning each role to a team member. The "why" is implied by their skills (e.g., Jeffrey as the artist on frontend).
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** An infographic of a kitchen. As Jeffrey explains each role, a part of the kitchen (oven, storefront, pantry) lights up with the corresponding team member's photo.
    2.  **Slide:** A simple organizational chart that uses kitchen icons instead of standard boxes (e.g., a chef's hat for Backend, an artist's palette for Frontend, a clipboard for Logistics/Pipeline).

## **3. Present a Demo of the Website/Product You Created**

### **a. Show how the website runs (focus on main functions).**
### **b. What are the main features of your product?**
*   **Covered in:** [Chapter 4: The Grandma Test](playbook.md#chapter-4-the-grandma-test---the-ultimate-validation)
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Mariana`` (guides the demo), ``@Jeffrey`` (drives the live demo), ``@Liang`` & ``@Dennis`` (explain the features).
*   **Timeline:** `[08:35 - 11:15]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** This is a **live demo** from start to finish. The focus is on core user actions: Sign Up, Add Food, View Results. The "Grandma Test" framing keeps it focused on simplicity and main functions.
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Live Demo:** This is the primary visual. Jeffrey should use a mouse highlighter tool to clearly indicate where he is clicking. The screen should be clean and free of distractions.
    2.  **Static Image:** For the detailed nutrient breakdown, use a pre-made, polished screenshot. This avoids potential live data issues and ensures the feature looks its best.

## **4. Show the Applied Technologies**

### **a. Which technologies have you used and why?**
### **b. How did you implement the technologies?**
*   **Covered in:** [Chapter 1: The Engine Room](playbook.md#chapter-1-the-engine-room---the-unseen-grind) and [Chapter 3: The Secret Sauce](playbook.md#chapter-3-the-secret-sauce-and-a-clever-name---the-invisible-bridge)
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Jeffrey`` (introduces the stack), ``@Dennis`` (explains VS Code, Django Admin, and the API).
*   **Timeline:** `[04:35 - 05:35]` and `[07:35 - 08:00]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** The technologies are not just listed; they are integrated into the story. Django is the "professional appliance," the API is the "waiter." This explains the "why" and "how" through analogy.
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** A "Tech Stack" slide designed like a recipe card. List the main technologies (Django, React, PostgreSQL, etc.) as "ingredients" with their logos.
    2.  **Animated Diagram:** During the API explanation, show a simple animation: a 'Frontend' icon sends a request to the 'API waiter,' who takes it to the 'Backend kitchen' and returns with 'Data' on a platter.

## **5. Talk About Teamwork, Challenges & Learnings**

### **a. What kind of technical and non-technical challenges did you face? How did you solve them?**
*   **Covered in:** [Preamble](playbook.md#preamble-setting-the-stage) (Scope Challenge) and [Chapter 2](playbook.md#chapter-2-the-pâtissiers-palette---the-art-of-illusion) (Skills Challenge).
*   **Speaker(s):** ``@Mariana`` (introduces the impossible 4-week timeline), ``@Jeffrey`` (describes the challenge of self-teaching frontend).
*   **Timeline:** `[03:55 - 04:30]` and `[05:40 - 07:15]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** Challenges are presented positively as obstacles that were overcome. The solution to the timeline was smart project management (the 'test cake'). The solution to the skills gap was individual initiative and resilience.
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** Show a calendar with a big red circle around a 4-week deadline, marked with an "IMPOSSIBLE!" stamp. This then transitions to a slide showing the "Test Cake" with a "SMART SOLUTION" stamp.
    2.  **Slide:** For Jeffrey's challenge, show a diagram of a single path splitting into many confusing, tangled routes (representing different libraries/frameworks), which then converge back to one clear, straight path labeled "Self-Taught & Focused."

### **b. What have you learned during the process?**
*   **Covered in:** [Grand Finale: The Taste of Triumph](playbook.md#grand-finale-the-taste-of-triumph)
*   **Speaker(s):** The entire team: ``@Jeffrey`` (asks), ``@Dennis``, ``@Mariana``, and ``@Liang`` (answer).
*   **Timeline:** `[11:20 - 13:40]`
*   **Presentation Cues:** This is the emotional conclusion of the presentation. Each team member shares a personal, reflective learning, transforming from a "student" to a "developer."
*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    1.  **Slide:** A final "Our Key Learnings" slide. As each person speaks, their photo is highlighted, and their core learning appears as a short, powerful quote next to it.
    2.  **Slide:** A simple, elegant slide with just the **BITAMINE** logo and the team's names. This keeps the focus entirely on the speakers as they deliver their final, personal messages.
