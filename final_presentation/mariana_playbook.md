Of course. This is the perfect way to prepare. An intuitive, personalized worksheet for each team member will ensure everyone knows their role, timing, and cues, while also having a dedicated space to prepare and communicate needs.

I have created the four individual `_playbook.md` files with the simple, intuitive layout you requested.

Here are the complete, ready-to-use worksheets for each team member.

    >
    > What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?
    >
    > This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.
    >
    > We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.
    *   **Verbal Hand-off to next speaker:**
    > "We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana. And now, **I'll hand you over to Jeffrey** to show you exactly how it works."

#### **Performance #2: The Final Thanks**
*   **Time Allotted with confidence. Your tone should be engaging and passionate.
*   **Performance #2 (Thanks):** This should be warm and sincere. Look directly at the camera to connect with the audience.

    > Because not everyone is healthy just by losing weight. Maybe *you're* looking to improve your sleep, for anti-aging, to gain muscle, or even get longer, brighter hair.
    >
    > This app was created by the **Bitamine** team. The name comes from **Bit**—the smallest unit of data—and **Amine**, an essential nutritional unit. This wasn't just our idea; Liang found us a **real customer** from the Netherlands who gave us the guidelines for this project.
