### **Your Performances**

#### **Performance #1: The Introduction**
*   **Time Allotted:** 1 minute, 30 seconds
*   **Slide:** #1 - GOAL OF THE APP
*   **Your Cue:** The presentation begins. You are the first speaker.
*   **Your Script:**
    > "Good morning. What if your nutrition app was for more than just weight loss?
    >
    > What if *you* wanted to sleep better, have more energy, or gain muscle?
    >
    > This is **Bitamine**. We track the macro and micro nutrients that matter for **your individual goals**, all in one simple, visual app.
    >
    > We built this based on a simple philosophy—'if you can cook, you can code'—for a **real customer** who needed a smarter solution.
    *   **Verbal Hand-off to next speaker:**
    > "We are the Bitamine team: Liang, Denis, Jeffrey, and myself, Mariana. And now, **I'll hand you over to Jeffrey** to show you exactly how it works."

#### **Performance #2: The Final Thanks**
*   **Time Allotted with confidence. Your tone should be engaging and passionate.
*   **Performance #2 (Thanks):** This should be warm and sincere. Look directly at the camera to connect with the audience.

#### **2. Technical Preparation:**
*   **Question:** You are the official backup "Slide Master." Do you have a copy of the final Google Slides presentation downloaded and ready to go in case Denis has a technical issue?
