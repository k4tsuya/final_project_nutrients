# **Slides Production & Cue Summary (`slides_sumup.md`)**

**Purpose:** This is the master checklist for our "Slide Master" (`@Dennis`). It details every slide needed for the presentation, in chronological order.

---

### **Main Presentation Slides (To be shown)**

1.  **Opening Title Slide**
    *   **Content:** The BITAMINE logo, the title "BITAMINE: The Bake-Off", and our four names with professional photos.
    *   **When:** Displayed from the very beginning until the end of the Preamble.

2.  **Chapter 1 Title / Tech Stack**
    *   **Content:** An infographic of a kitchen with our photos assigned to different roles (Backend, Frontend, API, etc.), or a simple "Tech Stack Recipe Card."
    *   **When:** Displayed at the start of Chapter 1, when `@Jeffrey` defines the terms.

3.  **Live Demo Transition**
    *   This is not a slide, but a technical action. `@Dennis` stops sharing so `@Jeffrey` can start. Be ready for this.

4.  **Grand Finale Slide**
    *   **Content:** A beautiful, polished screenshot of the final app dashboard.
    *   **When:** Displayed at the start of the Grand Finale, when `@Jeffrey` asks the final reflective questions.

5.  **Q&A Rules Slide**
    *   **Content:** Super minimalist. Title: "Q&A". Rules: "5 Minute Total Time", "One Question per Person". Note: "üëµ Remember the Grandma Test!"
    *   **When:** Displayed after the final "Thank You" and before the first question is taken.

6.  **Final Thank You Slide**
    *   **Content:** The BITAMINE logo, and the text "Thank You," along with a link to our GitHub repository or personal portfolios.
    *   **When:** Displayed at the very end of the Q&A session.

### **Appendix: Q&A Backup Slides (To be prepared)**
