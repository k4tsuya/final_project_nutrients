        We're Mariana, Jeffrey, Denis, and Liangâ€”four creators who decided to build something cool together.

    <p>Think of this app as our big idea, dreamed up on a sunny day.</p>
    <p>We brought our different skills in design, code, and planning </p>
    <p>to create a tool that makes healthy living simple and maybe even a little fun.</p>
    <p>It's our little piece of digital sunshine, built from scratch with a ton of teamwork and good vibes.</p>
    <p>We hope it makes your day a little brighter.</p>
